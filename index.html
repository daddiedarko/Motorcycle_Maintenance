    			<p>The basic components consist of the tires, hand controls, suspension forks and shock. Lights and fluids. These components need to at least be looked at once a week.</p>

        <p><strong>Check Chain Tension: </strong> Depending on your maintenance manual, make sure to keep the chain properly tensioned and oiled at least every week if riding in normal conditions and even more frequently when riding in wet or dusty conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Check Tire Conditions: </strong>Simply use a tire pressure gauge to make sure your at a adequate PSI, refer to your maintenance manual for specs. As for the tire tread make sure they are up to spec. Refer to your maintenance manual.</p>
        <p><strong>Change Your Motor Oil Frequently: </strong>As far as changing your oil, the owner's manual from the factory will have a mile range to how frequently to change your oil. The important thing to remember is to make sure that your oil doesn't get too old without changing it. For the average motorcycle one might change the oil every 1500 miles or so even if the manual states to change every 8000 miles. This is because I know that conventional motor oil will break down at 8000 miles and quit doing its job of lubricating effectively.</p>

  			<p>The ride day is here and you are excited to feel the wind your face.</p>
  			<p>The most important thing is to run down a pre-ride inspection of critical components.</p>
  			<p>First, check tire pressure. Second, check and make sure your brakes and brake lights are fully functioning and that the brake lines are not cracked or dry. Lastly, make sure you have plenty of petrol, and that you have basic tools to get yourself out of a pinch, or that you have a towing service ready to come to your aid.</p>
